# Laravel-like Boilerplate

Just a Laravel strip off with only the developer goodies. You'll have the simplicity of laravel-mix with al the power of webpack 3 under the hood in a HTML5 boilerplate.

## Quick start
1. Node.js, Git and npm.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run watch`.
